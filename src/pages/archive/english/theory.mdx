**Текст по теме:**
The first counting tools people used were sticks and stones. However, as the human mind developed over time, new computing devices were designed starting with the invention of the abacus in China, around 1300 BC. It was used to perform basic arithmetical operations – addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. The first mechanical adding machine, *the Pascaline*, was built by Blaise Pascal, a French mathematician and scientist, between 1642 and 1644. *The Pascaline* was able to perform addition and subtraction in short time. The device was basically a wooden box with a number of gears and wheels.

The first machine resembling today’s modern computers was *The Analytical Engine* designed in the 1830s by British mathematician Charles Babbage who is often called the father of the computer. He showed his machine at the exhibition in Paris in 1855.* The Analytical Engine* contained an ALU (arithmetic logic unit), control unit, memory, and an input/output system. These are the essential parts of a modern computer. Babbage never finished this work, but many of his ideas were the basis for building today’s computers.

The 19<sup>th</sup> century was a period of a rapid evolution of computing theory and a number of calculating machines began to be used at that time. However, it wasn’t until the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century that a major breakthrough in computing technology was made. In 1936 Konrad Zuse, a German engineer, developed the Z1 machine, the first programmable mechanical computing device, which was later followed by the Z2 and the Z3. This series of inventions led to the advent of the first fully-functioning programmable electro-mechanical computer.

The first generation of computers, which used vacuum tubes, came out in the 1940s. The milestone event was the invention of ENIAC (Electronic Numerical 5 Integrator and Computer) - the first general-purpose electronic digital computer working on vacuum tubes. The project was completed by two engineers at the University of Pennsylvania, John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, in 1946. Another important advancement in computers came in 1947, when John von Neumann developed the idea of keeping instructions for the computer inside the computer’s memory. UNIVAC I (Universal Automatic Computer), built in 1951, became the first commercially produced digital computer in the United States.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the second generation of computers was developed and could work ten times faster than their predecessors. The reason for this high speed was the use of transistors instead of vacuum tubes. The size of the computer also became smaller. The third-generation computers appeared on the market between 1965 and 1972. These computers could do a million calculations per second, which is 1000 times faster than the first-generation computers. Unlike second-generation computers, these were controlled by tiny integrated circuits and were consequently smaller.

In the fourth-generation computers, integrated circuits were greatly reduced in size, which was due to microminiaturization. In these computers, which came out in the mid- to late 1970s, 1000 tiny circuits could fit onto a single chip. Microprocessors even moved beyond the realm of computers and into an increasing number of everyday products. The fifth generation of computers, which is being developed nowadays, is based on parallel processing and Artificial Intelligence, a technology that has many potential applications around the world.

Geeks may roll their eyes at the news that Namibia is only now getting its first mainframe — a technology that most consider obsolete. Yet the First National Bank of Namibia, which bought the computer, is at the leading edge of a trend. Comeback is too strong a word, but mainframes no longer look that outdated.

Until the 1980s mainframes, so called because the processing unit was originally housed in a huge metal frame, ruled supreme in corporate data centers. Since then, these big bundles of software and hardware have been dethroned by “distributed systems”, meaning networks of smaller and cheaper machines. But many large companies still run crucial applications on the “big iron”: there are still about 10,000 in use worldwide. Withdraw money or buy insurance, and in most cases mainframes are handling the transaction.

Some companies like mainframes because they are reliable, secure and easy to maintain. But others have no choice. Banks, for instance, use decades-old applications to manage customer accounts. Moving these programs to other computers would be expensive and sometimes impossible. Most firms that can move off the mainframe have already done so.

High “switching costs” explain in large part why mainframes are still a good business for IBM. It is the only big firm left selling them, at prices that start at $100,000 but often reach the millions. Sales of mainframes are said to have brought in about $3.5 billion a year, on average, in the past decade. Although this is only about 3.5% of the firm’s overall revenue, each dollar spent on hardware pulls in at least as much from sales of software and maintenance contracts.

To preserve its mainframe business, IBM has regularly modernized its line-up of machines, lowering prices and improving performance. It has also given cash and computers to hundreds of universities and schools to get them to train replacements for retiring mainframe administrators.

In addition, IBM is trying to get customers to use mainframes for more functions. For some years, it has offered specialized add-on processors at considerably lower prices to run a greater variety of programs, mostly based on Linux, an open-source operating system. And last year IBM started bundling mainframes with applications at a discount. IBM is also trying to attract new customers, particularly in fast-growing emerging markets. Without mainframes, India’s Housing Development Finance Corporation and the Bank of China in Hong Kong would have a hard time dealing with their explosive growth.

The computer industry seems to be moving IBM’s way. The mainframe may well find a new home in corporate computing clouds, the pools of data processing capacity many firms are building. Many companies are increasingly interested in buying simpler, more integrated computer systems, even if this means a higher price.

##### Processing
The nerve center of a PC is the processor, also called the CPU, or central processing unit. This is built into a single chip which executes program instructions and coordinates the activities that take place within the computer system. The chip itself is a small piece of silicon with a complex electrical circuit called an integrated circuit.

The processor consists of three main parts:
* The control unit examines the instructions in the user's program, interprets each instruction and causes the circuits and the rest of the components - monitor, disk drives, etc. - to execute the functions specified.
* The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) performs mathematical calculations (+, -, etc.) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT).
* The registers are high-speed units of memory used to store and control data. One of the registers (the program counter, or PC) keeps track of the next instruction to be performed in the main memory. The other (the instruction register, or IR) holds the instruction that is being executed.

The power and performance of a computer is partly determined by the speed of its processor. A system clock sends out signals at fixed intervals to measure and synchronize the flow of data. Clock speed is measured in gigahertz (GHz). For example, a CPU running at 4GHz (four thousand million hertz, or cycles, per second) will enable your PC to handle the most demanding applications.

##### RAM and ROM
The programs and data which pass through the processor must be loaded into the main memory in order to be processed. Therefore, when the user runs a program, the CPU looks for it on the hard disk and transfers a copy into the RAM chips. RAM (random access memory) is volatile - that is, its information is lost when the computer is turned off. However, ROM (read only memory) is non-volatile, containing instructions and routines for the basic operations of the CPU. The BIOS (basic input/output system) uses ROM to control communication with peripherals. RAM capacity can be expanded by adding extra chips.

##### Buses and cards
The main circuit board inside your system is called the motherboard and contains the processor, the memory chips, expansions slots, and controllers for peripherals, connected by buses - electrical channels which allow devices inside the computer to communicate with each other. For example, the front side bus carries all data that passes from the CPU to other devices. The size of a bus, called bus width, determines how much data can be transmitted. It can be compared to the number of lanes on a motorway - the larger the width, the more data can travel along the bus. For example, a 64-bit bus can transmit 64 bits of data. Expansion slots allow users to install expansion cards, adding features like sound, memory and network capabilities.

##### ROM
ROM (read only memory) is a type of non-volatile storage medium used in computers and other electronic devices, such as washing machines, microwaves and others. Read only memory chip is an integrated circuit which houses the instructions required to start the work of a computer. BIOS software is stored on a non-volatile ROM chip. There are several types of read only memory:
1. MROM (Masked read-only memory);
2. PROM (Programmable read-only memory);
3. EPROM (Erasable programmable read-only memory);
4. EEPROM (Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory);
5. FLASH ROM.

**MROM** is the earliest kind of read-only memory; it is as old as semiconductor technology. It is no longer in use and has become outdated. This type of memory 37 contained a set of instructions encoded during the fabrication process. As a result, this type of pre-programmed chip could not be altered, reprogrammed, or erased later.

The **PROM** is a blank memory chip which is programmed later. This type of memory is kept empty while manufacturing, and one can program it using a device called a PROM programmer (or PROM burner). Once the chip has been programmed, its content cannot be altered. Therefore, it is also known as a one-time programmable device.

As the name suggests, an **EPROM** is a special type of memory chip which can be reprogrammed. High voltage can be used to program the programmable read-only memory to write data, and the data is retained until it is exposed to ultraviolet light for up to 10 minutes or longer. Thus, instructions stored in EPROM can be erased by ultraviolet light, and it can be reprogrammed again with new data.

**EEPROM** is a type of read-only memory that can be programmed and erased electrically. It has about 10,000 reprogramming and erase cycles where both erasing and programming take between 4 and 10 milliseconds. The EEPROM allows users to program and easily erase any selected location. It is erased one byte at a time rather than the entire chip. As a result, reprogramming may be flexible but tedious.

A contemporary variety of EEPROM is **Flash ROM**. Its modern designs have the feature of very high endurance, and flash memory can be erased and rewritten more quickly than conventional EEPROM (exceeding 1,000,000 cycles).

##### Cache memory
Most PCs are held back not by the speed of the CPU, but by the time it takes to move data in and out of the memory. One of the most important techniques for getting around this bottleneck is the CPU cache. The idea is to use a small number of very fast memory chips as a buffer between the main memory and the processor. Cache is a storage device found on the CPU chip itself. It carries the copies of original data that has been accessed recently and therefore increases the speed at which data is accessed. 39 Whenever the processor needs to read data, it looks in this cache area first. If it finds the data in the cache, then this counts as a ‘cache hit’ and the processor need not go through the more laborious process of reading data from the main memory. Only if the data is not in the cache does it need to access main memory, but it copies in the process whatever it finds into the cache so that it is there ready for the next time it is needed. The whole process is controlled by a group of logic circuits called the cache controller.

It is important to ensure that the cache and main memory contain consistent data. Two different techniques can be used to achieve this. In the write-through mode, data is simultaneously updated in cache and main memory. This method is simpler and safer for data coherency. However, the write-through process is quite slow since modifications have to be written in both the cache and main memory. The main alternative is the write-back mode, which allows the processor to write changes only to the cache first. The main memory is not updated until the cache block needs to be replaced. Cache entries that have been changed are flagged as ‘dirty’ telling the cache controller to write their contents back to the main memory before using the space to cache new data. A write-back cache speeds up the write process but requires a more advanced cache controller. Most cache controllers move a ‘line’ of data rather than just a single item each time they need to transfer data between main memory and the cache, thus increasing the chance of a cache hit. The amount of data transferred each time is known as the ‘line size’.

##### Magnetic Storage
Magnetic storage devices (magnetic tapes, floppy disks, hard disk drives) store data by magnetizing particles on a disk or tape. A floppy disk was so called because it consisted of a flexible sheet of plastic, coated with iron oxide — a magnetizable material. A floppy disk could spin at 360 revolutions per minute and store 1.44 MB of data.

A hard drive, however, can store much more data and retrieve information much faster. It consists of several plates that are made up of a magnetic material and known as platters. The surface of the magnetic plate is divided into billions of tiny compartments where data is stored. When data is recorded on an HDD, it is converted from the digital form (i.e. the binary combination of bits) into the analogue form (magnetized area). Magnetized tiny area of the plate denotes a binary one; whereas, the demagnetized tiny area denotes a binary zero. The transfer of bits takes place with the help of an electromagnet that is attached to the internal mechanism of the hard drive. The data bits containing the information are arranged in circular tracks. The tracks are further divided into smaller areas known as sectors.

Whenever the user provides a command to the computer to save information on the surface of the disk, the OS looks for the appropriate place required to save the data. Once the suitable place is located, the read/write head is made to move on the surface of the platter accordingly. Finally, the area on the surface of the disk gets magnetized and demagnetized as per the input data, and the data is successfully saved. To read the data or to retrieve back the saved information, the process gets reversed.

The OS allows you to create one or more partitions on your hard drive, in effect dividing it into several logical parts. Partitions let you install more than one operating system (e.g. Windows and Linux) on your computer. You may also decide to split your hard drive because you want to store the OS and programs on one partition and your data files on another; this allows you to reinstall the OS when a problem occurs, without affecting the data partition.

The average time required for the read/write heads to move and find data is called seek time (or access time) and it is measured in milliseconds (ms); most hard 44 drives have a seek time of 7 to 14 ms. Don't confuse this with transfer rate — the average speed required to transmit data from the disk to the CPU, measured in megabytes per second.

A hard disk is a delicate device that requires proper and careful handling. Here are some tips on how to protect your hard drive:
* Don't hit or move the computer while the hard drive is spinning. Hard drives are very sensitive to vibration and shocks, especially when they are operating; when the read/write head touches the rotating disk, it can scratch and damage the disk surface.
* You shouldn't turn your computer off and on quickly. Wait at least ten seconds to ensure that the drive has stopped spinning.
* To minimize the risk of data loss or corruption, you should install an up-to-date virus scanner. You should also back up your hard drive regularly.

##### Optical Storage
Optical storage is any storage type in which data is written as a series of reflective marks and read with a laser. Over the years, optical media have taken a variety of forms. The following formats, though, are considered standards in today's optical storage market:
* **The CD** (Compact Disc) represents the first generation of optical storage. Originally, CDs were available only as prerecorded read-only discs, but it wasn't long before they became available as recordable discs (CD-R) and rewritable discs (CD-RW) that could be used for data storage. The CD can hold up to 700 megabytes of data.
* At first sight, **the DVD** (Digital Versatile Disc) is similar to the CD. Both discs are 120 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm thick. They also both use a laser beam to read data. However, they are very different in internal structure and data capacity. In a DVD, the tracks are very close together, thus allowing more tracks. The pits in which data is stored are also smaller, so there are more pits per track. A single-layer DVD can hold 4.7 gigabytes of data, and a double-layer disc can hold 8.5 GB. As well as CDs, DVDs are available in read-only, recordable and rewritable formats.
* **The Blu-ray disc** has emerged as clear leader in today's optical storage market. Unlike CDs and DVDs, which use a red laser to read and write data, a Blu-ray disc 46 uses a blue laser, which dramatically increases capacities and data transfer rates over CDs and DVDs. Today's Blu-ray discs can store up to 128 GB of data and are available as read-only discs that can hold prerecorded high-definition feature films as well as recordable and rewritable discs for data storage.

One of the biggest advantages of optical storage over other storage media is durability. It’s not subjected to wear and no power failure may cause data losses. Among disadvantages of optical storage one can name its speed and capacity. The latest 12-cm Blu-ray discs top out at 128 GB, far below what is now possible with either HDDs or SSDs on a per-centimeter basis. At the same time, the rise of Internet streaming and USB flash drives has also diminished the reliance on optical discs.

##### Solid State Drive
A solid-state drive (SSD) is a type of nonvolatile storage media that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently. Two key components make up an SSD: a flash controller and flash memory chips. The architectural configuration of the SSD controller is optimized to deliver high read and write performance.

Unlike a hard disk drive (HDD), an SSD has no moving parts that can break if dropped. Because of this, SSDs can be subjected to much more shock and vibration than a hard drive, making them ideal for a broad range of portable and mobile devices.

Whereas a spinning HDD reads and writes data magnetically, an SSD reads and writes the data to interconnected flash memory chips, which are fabricated out of silicon. Manufacturers build SSDs by stacking chips in a grid.

SSDs offer significant advantages over standard hard drives. They are smaller and run quieter. Besides, they provide faster access and boot-up time but consume less power. Traditionally, hard drives offer greater capacity and a lower price, but the situation is changing rapidly as SSDs are becoming cheaper and are replacing hard drives in laptops and desktop PCs.

##### Types of Software
Software is a set of instructions, rules or programs used to operate a computer system and instruct the system to carry out specific tasks. In other words, software is a generic term, which refers to any programs running on desktop PСs, laptops, smartphones or other computer devices. Software can be classified into two main categories: system software and application software.

System Software is general-purpose software, which is used to operate computer hardware. It acts as an interface (i.e. provides communication) between application programs and computer hardware. System software is designed to manage the system resources and provide a platform for application software to run. Some common system software examples include:
* Operating Systems (a set of programs that manage computer hardware and software resources);
* Firmware (a permanent software or set of instructions stored in ROM (read-only memory) of the computer system);
* Device Drivers (a type of software that controls specific hardware of the computer system).

System software is usually written in low-level languages, like assembly languages, so that it could interact with the hardware at the maximum possible speed and provide an effective platform for the application programs.

Application software is designed to help the user perform a specific task, thus it is known as specific-purpose software. Unlike system software, which runs in the background, application software typically runs in the front-end making it more accessible to the user. It should be noted that application software cannot run on its own, it requires a platform created by the system software. Application software is usually written in high-level languages, like Java or C++.

The most common types of application software are:
* Word Processors which are used to create documents as well as edit, format and output text (e.g. MS Word, Google Docs);
* Database Software which helps in creating and managing databases (e.g. Oracle, MySQL);
* Web Browsers which are mainly used for surfing the Internet to help the user find specific web addresses or retrieve data across the web (e.g. Google Chrome, Internet Explorer).

##### Operating Systems
When a brand new computer comes off the factory assembly line, it can do nothing. The hardware needs software to make it work. A user can choose which application to install, but an application software package does not communicate directly with the hardware. That is where an Operating System comes in. It acts as an intermediary between application programs and computer hardware. As a user interacts with an application program on the screen, the application program communicates with the operating system and the operating system communicates with the computer hardware.

The work of the operating system takes place in the background and is not always obvious to the user. An operating system has a few main functions:
* managing the computer's hardware resources, such as the central processing unit, memory, and others;
* establishing a user interface;
* providing environment for application programs to run.

Operating systems can be classified according to different criteria.

###### Desktop and mobile operating systems
The desktop operating systems are designed to manage a personal computer. The most popular desktop operating systems are *Microsoft Windows* and *Mac OS*, while open-source operating systems such as *Linux* for example are also widely used.

The purpose of a mobile OS is to provide environment for application software to run on mobile devices. A mobile OS is similar to desktop OS but it is simpler in comparison, requires less RAM to operate and takes up less time to boot. Most popular mobile operating systems are *Android* and Apple’s *iOS*.

###### Single-tasking and multi-tasking operating systems
A single-tasking system can only run one program at a time. Nothing else will be done while the computer is doing this task. MS-DOS is an example of a singletasking operating system. On the contrary, a multi-tasking operating system allows more than one program to be executed by the CPU simultaneously by switching between the tasks. Multi-tasking Operating Systems are also known as time-sharing systems since the available processor time is divided between multiple processes. These processes are repeatedly interrupted in time intervals by the task scheduling subsystem of the operating system. Most of the present-day operating systems, like Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS are multi-tasking operating systems.

Multitasking may be characterized in preemptive and cooperative types. In preemptive multitasking, the overall computing time is divided between processes as the operating system allocates a time slice, or quantum, for each process. The OS uses some criteria to decide for how long a process should be executed before allowing another process to use the operating system. Thus, depending on a task's criticality and priority, additional time may be allocated. For example, OS-specific background tasks may be considered more important than a user application’s tasks. Thus, they receive larger time slices than forefront tasks. In cooperative multitasking, the operating system never initiates the switching between processes to share the CPU computing resources. A certain task uses the CPU resources until it voluntarily gives up the computing resources to another task. This type of multitasking is called *cooperative* because all the processes need to cooperate for the scheduling scheme to work.

###### Single-user and multi-user operating systems
In a single-user operating system, only one user can have access to the computer system at a time. These types of operating systems are common for home computers. Single-user operating systems can be classified into 2 types: single-user single-tasking operating systems and single-user multi-tasking operating systems.

A single-user single-tasking OS, as its name suggests, allows a single user to do only one task at a time. MS-DOS can serve as an example of a single-usersingle-tasking OS. In a single-user multi-tasking OS, a single user can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This is the types of OS that most users can find on their desktop and laptop computers today. For instance, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS allow a single user to have multiple programs running simultaneously. Thus, it is possible for a Windows user to be working on a word document while browsing the Internet at the same time.

A multi-user OS, on the other hand, provides resources and services to multiple users concurrently. The operating system needs to make sure that the computing resources are well-shared among different users based on their requirements and that the problems with one user will not affect the other users. Unix is a good example of a multi-user OS.

###### CLI operating systems and GUI operating systems
Some operating systems have the CLI (Command Line Interface); it means that the user runs a program by typing a command. When the command is typed and the *Enter key* is pressed, the command is processed and the output is displayed on the screen. The user needs only a keyboard to work with a CLI since it does not allow the use of any pointing devices. *Unix* is a command-driven operating system mostly used on large multi-user multi-tasking mainframe computers.

Other operating systems have the GUI (Graphical User Interface) that allows the user to use a mouse to click on icons on the screen or choose commands from a list of choices known as a menu. The distinct feature of a GUI is the use of WIMP environment: **w**indows, **i**cons, **m**enus and **p**ointer. The first computer with a graphical 59 use interface and a mouse was produced by Apple in 1984. Macs were designed with one clear aim: to facilitate interaction with the computer. A few years later, Microsoft launched Windows, another operating system based on graphics and intuitive tools. The GUI is easier for the user to work with since it is graphics-based, but it is slower and consumes more memory in comparison with the CLI.

With open-source software, what do people think first? Money, usually because open-source software is cheaper or free. However, this is not the only reason. First, there is freedom from the software vendors. Organizations say that freedom is the number one reason to choose open-source software. With open-source software, an organization doesn’t have to follow the software vendor’s decisions. Anyone can study and modify the open-source code. With proprietary software, the vendor controls software updates and users can’t add features to proprietary software themselves.

Sometimes people worry about open-source operating systems. They think that some software they use won’t run on open-source operating systems. However, this isn’t true because there is a lot of office software, such as word processors and spreadsheets, for open-source operating systems. In fact, there are many kinds of this software and they work well. It is only special areas, such as graphics design, where proprietary software is clearly better.

##### The OSI Model
OSI (Open System Interconnection) is a reference model that gives an idea of how data is transmitted over networks. This conceptual model was adopted in 1984 by International Organization for Standardization and has been widely used ever since by IT networking professionals as a guideline to describe how traffic moves from one part of the network to another. It is also important to note that this model is often used for troubleshooting if a network problem occurs. The OSI model consists of seven layers and at each layer there is a set of protocols, which may be very different depending on the kind of traffic going over a network.

At the very top of the OSI model there is the **application layer** whose work is implemented by network applications. The application layer is the only part of the communication process that the user sees. With the help of application layer protocols, a user can perform activities, like sending emails, transferring files, surfing the web etc. File transfer, for example, is done with FTP, while web surfing is implemented with HTTP or HTTPS protocols.

**The presentation layer** ensures that the message is transmitted in a language that the receiving computer can interpret (often ASCII). This layer also manages the encryption and decryption required by the application layer and then compresses the data it receives from the application layer before delivering it to layer 5.

**The session layer** creates communication channels called sessions. It has to ensure that the sessions are open, functioning and long enough to transfer the data. After all the data is transferred, it closes sessions. Layer 5 can also set checkpoints during communication where data is being transferred. If the session is interrupted, devices can resume the data transfer from the last checkpoint.

**The transport layer** is responsible for transferring data, providing errorchecking mechanisms and data flow control. This layer breaks the data it gets from the 68 session layer into transportable segments, creates checksum tests – mathematical sums based on the contents of data – that can be used later to determine if the data was scrambled. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and re-transmits the data if an error is found.

**The network layer** ensures the transmission of data from one host to the other located in a different network. The segments received from the transport layer are further processed to form packets. Then the best path is found to route the data to its destination. The network layer uses logical addresses (Internet Protocol addresses) to route data to a destination node. IP addresses of the receiving and sending computers are added at this layer.

**The data link layer** manages data transfer between two devices on the same network. It is also responsible for flow control and error control in intra-network communication. The packets received from the network layer are further divided into frames and transmitted to the appropriate host using its MAC address.

**The physical layer** is the lowest layer of the OSI model and it is responsible for transmitting raw bits of data from one node to the other over physical cable or wireless connection.

So, in order to accomplish a successful communication between computers, data must travel down the seven layers in the source computer and then go up through the layers in the receiving computer.

##### Types of networks
A network is a collection of computers, servers and network devices connected to one another to allow the sharing of data. Networks can be classified according to different criteria.

###### Geographical area
**LANs** (Local Area Networks) cover a small geographical area such as an office, a home, a building, or a group of buildings. **MANs** (Metropolitan Area Networks) span 70 an entire city. **WANs** (Wide Area Networks) cover a country or a continent. The largest WAN in existence is the Internet, which connects millions of people all over the world.

###### Network architecture
The two types of network architecture are peer-to-peer and client-server. In a **client-server** network, one computer acts as a server. It stores and distributes data to the other nodes, or clients. In a **peer-to-peer** network, all the computers have the same capabilities - that is, share files and peripherals without requiring a separate server computer.

###### Topology
A network topology is a configuration of the elements of a network. Typical network configurations include the **bus** topology, **mesh** topology, **ring** topology, **star** topology, **tree** topology and **hybrid** topology. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install. Let’s have a look at the distinct features of the network topologies mentioned above.

**Bus network:** all nodes are connected to a single cable that acts as the backbone of the entire network. There is no limit to the number of nodes that can be connected to this network.

**Star network:** all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a Wireless LAN, where each wireless client connects to the central wireless access point.

**Ring topology:** each device/node is connected with its neighboring node forming the shape of a ring, hence its name. In a ring topology, data circulates from one computer to another. The flow of data in a ring topology can be uni-directional or bi-directional.

**Mesh topology:** a network topology in which the infrastructure nodes (i.e. bridges, switches, and other infrastructure devices) connect directly and nonhierarchically to as many other nodes as possible.

**Tree topology:** all the computers are connected like the branches of a tree. In computer networking, tree topology is known as a combination of a bus and star network topologies. The main advantages of this topology are better flexibility and scalability.

**Hybrid topology:** this type includes a mix of bus topology, mesh topology, ring topology, star topology, and tree topology. The combination of topologies depends on the need of a company.

###### Wired and wireless networks
In wired LAN, two or more personal computers are connected through such communication media as **coaxial** or **twisted-pair** cables. High-speed **fiber optic** cables are usually used to send data over longer distances.

Wireless networks, on the other hand, use electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves, to transmit data. These are the main types of wireless networks:
* Satellite networks for long distances;
* WiMAX for connecting Wi-Fi hotspots;
* Wi-Fi for medium-range distances;
* Bluetooth for short distances;
* GSM for mobile phones.

Wired networks are considered faster and more reliable. Wireless networks let you move from one access point to another, but they are less secure and subject to interference.
